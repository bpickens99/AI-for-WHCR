# AI-for-WHCR
### This repository contains R and Python code for conducting deep learning, computer vision analyses. Specifically, the code has been developed to detect and classify Whooping Crane. Please contact Brad Pickens, bradley_pickens@fws.gov, for more information or for questions.

### The realm covered here includes imagery management and preprocessing, annotation conversions, deep learning model training/testing, post-processing, and statistical analyses. Project-specific code is tailored to ongoing USFWS projects. 

### Our Github repository is a synthesis of gathering numerous Github and open-source materials, plus the addition of made-from-scratch code to fill in the gaps when needed. We are grateful for the repositories represented here as direct packages, and code sources, but also as a basis for code that is further tailored to meet the needs of applying deep learning models to wildlife and fisheries challenges. We thank the many contributors who have provided code, and we have done our best to cite such code. Please contact me if you would like changes to citations or similar content. Thank you and enjoy!
